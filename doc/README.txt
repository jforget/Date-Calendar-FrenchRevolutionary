This directofy gives designer's notes for I<all> calendar modules, not
only the French Revolutionary calendar module.

These notes  are typeset using  Raku's POD6  markup, which is  not yet
recognized by Github. So you need to click the "raw" button to see the
unprocessed  POD6 source,  which is  easier  to read  than the  source
typeset with a wrong formatter program.
